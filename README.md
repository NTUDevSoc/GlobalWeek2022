# Duolingo Competition App
This is a web application I made for use during a Nottingham Trent University - Global Week stand for DevSoc.

It was made using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [duolingo-api](https://github.com/JinKim7/duolingo-api)

Some of the functionality includes:
+ Being able to add people to the rankings, along with their username and the language they are learning.
+ Being able to delete users if they no longer to participate or were added in error.
+ Being able to update the standings with the use of a button.
